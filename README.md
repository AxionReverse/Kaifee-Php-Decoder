# Kaifee-Php-Decoder
Kaifeeâ€™s protection encrypts PHP using custom char maps, layered Base64-style encodes, and double AES-256-CBC encryption. AxionReverse decoder auto-extracts mappings, decodes keys and IVs, performs dual AES decryption, then reverses ROT13 and Base64 to rebuild the original PHP payload. Protection by Kaifee. Decoder by AxionReverse.
